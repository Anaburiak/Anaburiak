## Hi there 👋
I'm Ana, a ML-engineer based in Russia.
I put my heart and soul into my projects to make them effective and automate the boring stuff.
My main tech stack is Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn. Also I love low-code/no-code tools like n8n and LangFlow.
At the moment I'm working on an AI agent to upgrade educational process.
I'm currently learning RAG, Qdrant, LangFlow, Docker, Fast API
